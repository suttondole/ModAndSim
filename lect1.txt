Review
Simulation model - set of assumptions concerning the operation of the system, expressed as mathematical, logical, and symbolic expressions between the object of interests (entities) of the system

What is a system?
Entity - object of interest in the system
Attribute: property of an entity
Activity: predefined set of actions in a specified time period
State of system: collections of variables that describes the system at any time
Event: Instantaneous occurence that may be associated with change of system state
System Environment: region outside the system that influences system behavior. (How do we choose the boundary?)

Mcdonalds simulation

Objective: minimize the delay experienced by the customers waiting to be served
Performance: Delay in Queues (Lines)
Alternative Designs:
	    Number of servers
	    Architecture of queueing system
	    		 One line shared by all custormers vs individual lines for each server
			 Pipelining orders? One server takes orders, one serves, one cashier?
Simulation outcome: predict the delay performance of the real system based on the model

Attributes
-Source: arrival distribution for customers
-Queue: physical length limitation; queue behavior
-Server: distribution of service time

Actions
-How to best describe actions: use flowcharts
-Actions are the response of modules to events
-Source: Waitfor specified time between arrivals, then generate another arrival
-Server: serve the current customer at the head of the line

State of the System
-We are interested in variables that influence the delay performance
-Length of queues
-State of servers: busy idle

Events
-Change the state variable
-Recall: Discrete time system, events only occur at discrete times
-Arrivals
-Departures
